# Assigment Week 9 - DATABASE

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Ireng Febrian Sanjaya. I'm entering week 9 and I practicing in making database with MySQL with DBeaver as the viewer and learning Redis of financial tracker this week and I do struggle alot in making this. P.s: Still the same struggle from last week that I need alot of time to learn the logic, computational thinking and the connection on each part of the code. I try my best for this one. My class do teach me how to use Redis, but for this one i'm not using Redis because the time isn't scheduling.

## Tools

- JAVASCRIPT
- DBEAVER
- MYSQL
- CYCLIC


## Process MYSQL 
For this project I run MySQL on docker and using Dbeaver as the viewer and making the data for transaction and user in Dbeaver. After making the data on Dbeaver, I connect MySQL to my Node.JS by installing MySQL 2 on Node.JS Dependencies. Here is the picture below of my connection for MySQL

## Postman for Test API
I'm using postman to test my API and here is some example that I tested below;

1. **Get** 'api/user/:id' with id = number
![GET](Readme%20Documentation/PostmanGet.png)
2. **Put** 'api/transaction/:id' with id =number
![PUT](Readme%20Documentation/PostmanPut.png)
3. **Post** 'api/transaction'
![POST](Readme%20Documentat
4. **Delete** 'api/transaction/:id' with id = number
![DELETE](Readme%20Documentation/PostmanDelete.png)
